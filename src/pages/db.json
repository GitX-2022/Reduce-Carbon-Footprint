      "title": "Carbon footprint",
      "body": "Today, the term “carbon footprint” is often used as shorthand for the amount of carbon (usually in tonnes) being emitted by an activity or organization. \nThe carbon footprint is also an important component of the Ecological Footprint, since it is one competing demand \nfor biologically productive space. Carbon emissions from burning fossil fuel accumulate in the atmosphere \nif there is not enough biocapacity dedicated to absorb these emissions. Therefore, \nwhen the carbon footprint is reported within the context of the total Ecological Footprint, the tonnes of carbon dioxide \nemissions are expressed as the amount of productive land area required to sequester those carbon dioxide emissions. This tells us how \nmuch biocapacity is necessary to neutralize the emissions from burning fossil fuels."

      "body": "The Ecological Footprint is a simple metric. \nIt is also uniquely comprehensive. Not only does it measure humanity’s demand on our \nplanet’s ecosystems, but it is also key to understanding the \ninter-related pressures of climate change on the natural ecosystems \non which humanity depends."

      "body": "The carbon component of the Ecological Footprint—which we call the carbon Footprint—measures the \narea of forestland that is required to absorb all the \ncarbon emissions from human activity in excess of what the oceans already absorb (the carbon Footprint can also be \nexpressed in tonnes of CO2 emitted). Currently, the carbon Footprint makes up 60% of humanity’s Ecological Footprint.\n It is inextricably linked to the other components of the Ecological Footprint—cropland, \ngrazing land, forests and productive land built over with buildings \nand roads—since all these demands compete for space, as mentioned above."

It\n includes direct emissions, such as those that result from fossil-fuel combustion \nin manufacturing, heating, and transportation, \nas well as emissions required to produce the electricity associated with goods and \nservices consumed. In addition, the carbon footprint concept also often includes the emissions of \nother greenhouse gases, such as methane, \nnitrous oxide, or chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)."
